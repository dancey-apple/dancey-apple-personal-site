            <p>Like most millennials (*shudder* I know) I grew up with tech. I had an NES/PS1/Etc.. and when they stopped working, it was up to me to troubleshoot and fix it. I'm a natural troubleshooter, motivated learner, and always curious about the world.</p>
            <p>I'm always looking for new ways to AUTOMATE my life. (I bought a fish, and instead of cleaning the tank myself, I also bought snails to clean the tank for me!).</p>
            <p>I've been in Tech since 2017, working in nearly every aspect that did NOT require coding skills, from QA to Incident Management. But I felt that that limited my value and started my code path in 2020 slowly working on self-taught lessons on YT and REPLIT. I moved on to the OKCoders 2024 bootcamp and have been coding ever since!</p>
